How to use params when changing states

Compare the original plunker http://plnkr.co/edit/gmtcE2?p=preview with this example.
Look at file contacts.list.html to see ng-ref replaced with ui-sref for state transition instead of plain url routing.
Note that index contains all that is needed to run in plunker or jsfiddle. The other files are left as 
an exercise in proper refactoring.
